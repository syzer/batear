## What is Batear?

Drones are an increasing threat to homes, farms, and communities — and effective detection has traditionally required expensive radar or camera systems. **Batear changes that.**

For ultra-low-cost hardware, Batear turns a tiny ESP32-S3 microcontroller and a MEMS microphone into an always-on acoustic drone detector. It runs entirely at the edge — **no cloud subscription, no internet connection, no ongoing cost.** Deploy one at a window, a fence line, or a rooftop and it will alert you the moment drone rotor harmonics are detected nearby.

The same codebase builds as a **Detector** (mic + LoRa TX) or a **Gateway** (LoRa RX + OLED + LED), selectable at build time.

## Key Features

- :microphone: **Acoustic detection** — FFT harmonic signature analysis of drone rotor noise
- :lock: **AES-128-GCM encryption** — secure LoRa communication between devices
- :satellite: **LoRa alerting** — long-range, low-power wireless alerts
- :zap: **Edge-only** — no cloud, no internet, no subscription
- :moneybag: **Ultra-low-cost** — under $20 per node with off-the-shelf parts
- :package: **Single codebase** — builds as Detector or Gateway via config
