# Detection Algorithm

## FFT Harmonic Signature

Batear reads audio from an ICS-43434 I2S MEMS microphone at **16 kHz** and runs a **1024-point real FFT** (via ESP-DSP SIMD-accelerated routines) to produce a power spectral density (PSD) with **15.625 Hz/bin** resolution.

Multi-rotor drones produce a characteristic acoustic signature: a strong **fundamental frequency** (f₀, tied to motor/propeller RPM) plus clearly visible **harmonics at 2×f₀ and 3×f₀**. Batear exploits this by scanning the PSD for peaks that exhibit this harmonic ladder pattern.

## Detection Pipeline

### Harmonic Analysis

For each candidate f₀ (180–2400 Hz), the detector checks whether energy peaks also exist near 2×f₀ and 3×f₀ relative to the noise floor.

### Confidence Scoring

A 0–1 heuristic combining SNR, h2/h3 ratios, and exponential moving average smoothing reduces false alarms from transient sounds.

### Hysteresis

Alarm requires **2 consecutive** positive frames; clearing requires **8 consecutive** negative frames — eliminating flicker.

### ESP-DSP Accelerated

The ESP32-S3's SIMD instructions keep the full FFT + harmonic scan well under 10 ms per frame.

## Alert Transmission

When a drone signature is confirmed, an **AES-128-GCM encrypted** alert is transmitted over LoRa to the gateway. See the [LoRa Protocol](protocol.md) page for packet format details.
